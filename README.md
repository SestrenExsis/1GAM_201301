REDRAWN
===========

My January 2013 Entry for One Game a Month. The optional theme is RESPAWN.

The latest (mostly) stable build can be played at:

Most levels begin with a blank canvas and the entire canvas selected, although a few levels begin with some artwork already on the canvas. The goal of the game is to use the NUMPAD to interface with the toolset and recreate the target pixel art from the starting canvas.

The keys can be remapped from the settings screen on the main menu, in case you don't have a NUMPAD for your keyboard.
